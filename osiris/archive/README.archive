In the archives folder, you'll find some of the older files from the original Qt distribution.

These have been preserved for historical purposes, as they are no longer in use or made obsolete
by the forked version (Osiris) used in ZFreeKit.

This folder should be viewed as the root view for the Qt2 source, and will maintain the original hierarchy.
