ZFreeKit is intended to house libraries and applications that are complimentary to the X11 X Windows System (X.Org/ZFreeKit), and also GGE.

A fork of Qt2 is maintained as a patchset. This allows us to remain in compliance with both the QPL and the GPL.

!! WARNING: ZFreeKit is in development. It may be unstable, and have significant security issues. DO NOT USE on a production system. !!

See CHANGELOG-ZFreeKit.qt2 for changes related to Qt2 fork.

The Qt2 portion is known to compile and work on both x86 and amd64 platforms, when configured with './configure -shared', and no other options.
