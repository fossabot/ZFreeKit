          Osiris 2.3.3 Source-testing

Osiris is a fork of the original official release of the Qt Free Edition version 2.3.2,
and should be considered the upstream version if you wish to obtain updates for use on
a modern sytem. Please note, that this is *not* the embedded or commercial version of Qt.

Osiris is distributed under the original licensing terms.

Currently supported platforms:

- Illumos/OpenIndiana	-	G++
- Linux					-	G++
- FreeBSD				- 	G++

Osiris aims to be as source-compatible as possible for existing Qt2-based applications.
It is strongly recommended to re-compile existing applications against Osiris to take
advantage of any improvements, and prevent unusual bugs. Osiris does not claim to be
binary-compatible.

*** IMPORTANT - SECURITY ADVISORY ***

This is old code, and has not been maintained for many years until now! While ZFreeKit is working on
making this software usable again, it likely (almost definitely!) contains unpatched vulnerabilities. 
DO NOT use on production systems at this time.

Most notably, this includes the bundled libraries, which are very old versions. Osiris currently
depends on these, although they will be updated soon.

*** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! ***

The INSTALL file details how to compile and install Osiris.

99.9% of the included documentation is correct. If you notice any omissions or errors, please
report them (see below).

=== Support, Bug Reports, Updates, and Feature Requests ===

You can request support, report bugs, and submit feature requests on the ZFreeKit Github repository.

All issues about Osiris/Qt2 should have the label "Osiris" attached to them, as ZFreeKit contains multiple
software components.

The 'osiris' branch is the development branch for Osiris/Qt2. Releases will be under the 'master' branch,
available as a patchset with instructions to apply the patches.
