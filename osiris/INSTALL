			  INSTALLING Osiris FOR X11


You may need to be root, depending on the permissions of the directories
where you choose to install Osiris. It is strongly recommended to install
Osiris in /opt, as this will help eliminate potential conflicts.


1.  Osiris is part of ZFreeKit. Unzip the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd /opt
	unzip ZFreeKit-master.zip	# unzip the archive

    This creates the directory /opt/ZFreeKit containing the
    files from the main archive.

    Copy Osiris into /opt, and create compatibility symlink:

	mv ZFreeKit/osiris .
	ln -s osiris qt2

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is installed in /opt/osiris.


2.  Set some environment variables in the file .profile (or .login,
    depending on your shell) in your home directory. (Create the
    file if it is not there already.)

	QT2DIR		   - wherever you installed Qt
	PATH		   - to locate the moc program and other Qt tools
	MANPATH 	   - to access the Qt man pages
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH	   - for the shared Qt library

    This is done like this:

    In .profile (if your shell is bash, ksh, zsh or sh), add the
    following lines:

	QT2DIR=/opt/osiris
	PATH=$QT2DIR/bin:$PATH
	MANPATH=$QT2DIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QT2DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	export QT2DIR PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following lines:

	setenv QT2DIR /opt/osiris
	setenv PATH $QT2DIR/bin:$PATH
	setenv MANPATH $QT2DIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QT2DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    After you have done this, you will need to login again, or
    re-source the profile before continuing, so that at least $QT2DIR
    is set.  The installation will give an error message and not
    proceed otherwise.


3.  In the original Qt2, a commercial license was available. Osiris is not.
	This section has been removed.


4.  Building.

    This step compiles the Qt library, and builds the example programs,
    the tutorial, and the tools (eg. the Designer).

    Type:

	./configure

    This will configure the Qt library for your machine. Note that
    GIF support is turned off by default. Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. Read PLATFORMS for a
    list of supported platforms.

    To create the library and compile all examples and the tutorial:

	make
	
	You can speed up the compilation time by using the -j flag when running
	make. On a dual-core system for example, you could use:
	
	make -j2

    If your platform or compiler is not supported, read PORTING.  If it is
    supported but you have problems, see the README for support information.


5.  In very few cases you may need to run /sbin/ldconfig or something
    similar at this point if you are using shared libraries.

    If you have problems running the example programs, e.g. messages like

	 can't load library 'libqt.so.2'

    you probably need to put a reference to the qt library in a
    configuration file and run /sbin/ldconfig as root on your system.
    And don't forget to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as explained in 2) above.


6.  The online HTML documentation is installed in /opt/osiris/doc/html/
    The main page is /opt/osiris/doc/html/index.html
    The man pages are installed in /opt/osiris/doc/man/



That's all.  Osiris is now installed.
